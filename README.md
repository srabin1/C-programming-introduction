1. To resolve the issue with scanf you can add a #pragma warning(disable:4996) on the top of the file, you can replace it with scanf_s, or you can simply add a space before entering your text like: scanf(" enter your text after inserting a space");
2. If while loop is not working for non-initiative variable you can replace it with do while loop
3. Same problem for openf, openf_s, ...
